[00:04.35] Oh, baby
[00:09.50] Oh, man
[00:13.00] 
[00:14.62] You're making me crazy
[00:19.72] Really driving me mad
[00:30.22] 
[00:25.15] That's all right with me
[00:30.22] It's really no fuss
[00:35.46] As long as you're next to me
[00:40.60] Just the two of us
[00:49.60] 
[00:47.19] You're my, my, my
[00:51.75] My kind of woman
[00:59.75] 
[00:57.98] My, oh my
[01:02.59] What a girl
[01:08.05] You're my, my, my
[01:12.74] My kind of woman
[01:20.74] 
[01:18.64] And I'm down on my hands and knees
[01:20.95] Begging you please, baby
[01:24.14] Show me your world
[01:33.14] 
[01:33.58] Oh, brother
[01:38.44] Sweetheart
[01:43.51] I'm feeling so tired
[01:48.67] Really falling apart
[01:58.67] 
[01:53.92] And it just don't make sense to me
[01:59.12] I really don't know
[02:04.44] Why you stick right next to me
[02:09.86] Wherever I go
[02:16.36] 
[02:16.17] You're my, my, my
[02:20.79] My kind of woman
[02:28.79] 
[02:26.98] My, oh my
[02:31.42] What a girl
[02:36.92] 
[02:37.12] You're my, my, my
[02:41.68] My kind of woman
[02:49.68] 
[02:47.48] And I'm down on my hands and knees
[02:50.10] Begging you please, baby
[02:53.00] Show me your world
